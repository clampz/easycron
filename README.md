easycron
========

This is a utility for modifying a user's crontab

Easycron's main usage is to add processes to the user's crontab without having to know the format that crontab accepts. It also has a delete, and list option.

For example: ```easycron 30min '/path/to/example.sh'``` adds the ```/path/to/example.sh``` executable to the crontab to run every 30 min.

Options:
* -d **delete option takes a search term and deletes the line where it finds the term. usage:** ```easycron -d 'process_to_delete'```
* -l **concatinates the crontab file to the command line.**

To install easycron, use the following command (while inside the downloaded repo file): 
```
make install
```
